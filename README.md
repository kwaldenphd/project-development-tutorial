# Developing Project Next Steps

## STAGE ONE: Scoping your project, identifying goals
We'll start by expanding on the group notes created yesterday afternoon.

Open the document for your project. Review the notes created yesterday and add your own thoughts, ideas, comments, and questions.

[DOCUMENT LINKS GO HERE]

<em>Questions to review:</em>
<ul>
 	<li><em>What type of data? Where is it, and what condition is it in?</em></li>
 	<li><em>What are the research questions, or research topics?</em></li>
 	<li><em>What types of technology will be needed, or what types of technology could be useful?</em></li>
 	<li><em>Who is the audience for this project?</em></li>
 	<li><em>What do you find interesting about this project?</em></li>
 	<li><em>What questions do you have about this project?</em></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>Additional questions for today:</blockquote>

## STAGE TWO: Identifying Relevant Technologies

Thinking about the types of technology you identified as needed or useful……
<ul>
 	<li>List possible programs, tools, software, etc.</li>
 	<li>What are you already familiar with?</li>
 	<li>What seems like the best fit?</li>
 	<li>What information will help you decide how to move forward?</li>
 	<li>How can you learn more about possible tools and whether they will be a good fit for this project?</li>
</ul>

Start with the <a href="http://2019bootcamp.vivero.sites.grinnell.edu/tutorials/project-management/">Planning and Managing your Digital Project page</a>, and explore other resources under the Additional Resources tab. This is time to think about digital tools, methods, and approaches; assess your level of familiarity or expertise with those tools; and begin to figure out how to move forward.

## STAGE THREE: Collaboration, Labor, and Workflow

Thinking about the questions you had about this project, imagine are meeting with this faculty member.
<ul>
 	<li><em>What questions do you need to ask?</em></li>
 	<li><em>What questions would you like to ask?</em></li>
 	<li><em>What questions are you afraid to ask (or are not sure how to ask)?</em></li>
</ul>

Some questions that can help clarify expectations for your work and collaboration on the project:
<ul>
 	<li><em>How will we communicate (email, Slack, etc.)?</em></li>
 	<li><em>Where will we store files (OneDrive, Dropbox, etc.)?</em></li>
 	<li><em>Will we meet in person? How often will we meet? Where will we meet? Who will schedule meetings?</em></li>
 	<li><em>What other kind of project updates are needed?</em></li>
 	<li><em>What is our plan if we need to reach out to other campus resources (Libraries, DLAC, etc.)? Who will arrange those conversations?</em></li>
 	<li><em>How will decisions be made for the project? How much does the faculty member want or expect to be involved in aspects of the project?</em></li>
 	<li><em>What are our personal preferences and past experiences about what makes an effective, positive collaboration? How will we address issues if those expectations are not being met?</em></li>
</ul>

Often, these types of questions can be addressed in informal conversations or an initial meeting. However, as we’ll learn about more this afternoon, people communicate and interact in a wide variety of ways, and the inter-relatedness of identity and power shapes how we communicate and interact. Talk to Carolyn, Liz, or Katie if you are interested in developing a memorandum of understanding, or charter, for your collaboration and project.

## STEP FOUR: Group Reflection

Report back with a summary of your next steps. Have a question or thought to share with the larger group that we can brainstorm or problem solve together.
<ul>
 	<li><em>As of right now, where do you see the project going?</em></li>
 	<li><em>As of right now, what will you be learning more about for the project?</em></li>
 	<li><em>A question for the group, or something we could brainstorm or work on together?</em></li>
</ul>
